## üìò Problem: Word Search

**LeetCode ID:** 79  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Backtracking, DFS, Matrix Traversal, Search Pruning

---

### üßæ Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are **horizontally or vertically** neighboring. The same letter cell may **not** be used more than once.

---

### üì• Input

- `board`: 2D character matrix of size `m x n`
- `word`: String of length up to 15

### üì§ Output

- `true` if the word exists in the grid, `false` otherwise

---

### üìö Examples

#### Example 1

```txt
Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
], 
word = "ABCCED"

Output: true
```

#### Example 2

```txt
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]
word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

#### Example 3

```txt
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]
word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

---

### üß† Approach

We use **backtracking + DFS** to explore the board and check if the word exists by following these steps:

---

### üîç Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Search Start**  
   Loop through each cell in the grid. If the character at that cell matches the first character of the word, trigger a recursive DFS.

2. **Backtracking Logic**  
   At each step:
   - Check for out-of-bound or already visited cell.
   - If the current character matches, recursively check in all 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Use a `Set` to track visited positions in `"r,c"` format to avoid revisiting.

3. **Pruning Optimization**  
   - Reverse the word if the last character is rarer than the first one to fail early (search pruning).
   - Use a `HashMap<Character, Integer>` to count frequency of characters in the word.

### üßÆ Time & Space Complexity

| Type              | Complexity         |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Time Complexity   | `O(m * n * 4^L)`   |
| Space Complexity  | `O(L)` recursion stack, `O(L)` visited set |

Where `m x n` is the grid size and `L` is the length of the word.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean backtrack(char[][] board, int r, int c, int k, Set<String> visited, String word, int rows, int cols){
        if(k == word.length()){
            return true;
        }

        if(r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || 
           visited.contains(r + "," + c) || 
           board[r][c] != word.charAt(k)){
            return false;
        }

        visited.add(r + "," + c);

        boolean res = backtrack(board, r - 1, c, k + 1, visited, word, rows, cols) ||
                      backtrack(board, r + 1, c, k + 1, visited, word, rows, cols) ||
                      backtrack(board, r, c + 1, k + 1, visited, word, rows, cols) ||
                      backtrack(board, r, c - 1, k + 1, visited, word, rows, cols);

        visited.remove(r + "," + c);

        return res;
    }

    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        int rows = board.length;
        int cols = board[0].length;
        HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

        // Frequency map for characters in the word
        Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
        for(char c : word.toCharArray()){
            charCount.put(c, charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Word reversal optimization
        if(charCount.getOrDefault(word.charAt(0), 0) > 
           charCount.getOrDefault(word.charAt(word.length() - 1), 0)){
            word = new StringBuilder(word).reverse().toString();
        }

        for(int r = 0; r < rows; r++){
            for(int c = 0; c < cols; c++){
                if(backtrack(board, r, c, 0, visited, word, rows, cols)){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### üß™ Dry Run (word = "ABCCED")

```txt
Start at (0,0): 'A' ‚Üí ‚úî
Right to (0,1): 'B' ‚Üí ‚úî
Right to (0,2): 'C' ‚Üí ‚úî
Down to (1,2): 'C' ‚Üí ‚úî
Down to (2,2): 'E' ‚Üí ‚úî
Left to (2,1): 'D' ‚Üí ‚úî
‚Üí All characters matched ‚Üí return true ‚úÖ
```

---

### üß∞ Additional Enhancements (Optional)

- Use a `boolean[][] visited` array instead of a `Set` for faster performance.
- Avoid using `r+","+c` strings ‚Äî integer-based keys or visited matrix is more efficient.

### `üìò Problem: Word Search`

**LeetCode ID:** 79  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topic:** Backtracking, DFS, Recursion

---

#### üßæ Problem Description

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are **horizontally or vertically** neighboring. The same letter cell may **not be used more than once**.

---

### üì• Input

- `board`: 2D character grid
- `word`: a string to search in the grid

---

### üì§ Output

- Boolean: `True` if word exists in the grid, else `False`

---

### üìö Examples

**Example 1:**

```txt
Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
], 
word = "ABCCED"

Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```txt
Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
], 
word = "SEE"

Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```txt
Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","E"],
  ["S","F","C","S"],
  ["A","D","E","E"]
], 
word = "ABCB"

Output: false
```

---

### üß† Approach

We use **backtracking (DFS)** to explore each cell recursively to match the given word.

---

### üîç Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### Step 1: Loop through each cell in the grid  
Check each cell. If the cell matches the first character of the word, initiate a DFS search from that cell.

#### Step 2: DFS Search  
- From each starting point, recursively check all 4 adjacent directions (up, down, left, right).
- Maintain a visited state by **temporarily marking cells**.
- Restore the cell after the search (backtracking step).

#### Step 3: Return true if the word is found, else false

### üßÆ Time & Space Complexity

| Type              | Complexity       |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Time Complexity   | `O(m * n * 4^L)` where `L = len(word)` |
| Space Complexity  | `O(L)` recursion stack |

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Code (Python)

```python
def exist(board, word):
    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

    def dfs(r, c, i):
        if i == len(word):  # All letters matched
            return True
        if (
            r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or
            board[r][c] != word[i]
        ):
            return False

        temp = board[r][c]
        board[r][c] = '#'  # Mark as visited

        # Explore all 4 directions
        found = (
            dfs(r+1, c, i+1) or
            dfs(r-1, c, i+1) or
            dfs(r, c+1, i+1) or
            dfs(r, c-1, i+1)
        )

        board[r][c] = temp  # Restore for backtracking
        return found

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if board[r][c] == word[0] and dfs(r, c, 0):
                return True

    return False
```

---

### üß™ Dry Run on Example 1

```txt
Word: ABCCED
Start from board[0][0] = 'A' ‚Üí match
Go right ‚Üí 'B' ‚Üí match
Go right ‚Üí 'C' ‚Üí match
Go down ‚Üí 'C' ‚Üí match
Go down ‚Üí 'E' ‚Üí match
Go left ‚Üí 'D' ‚Üí match ‚Üí Word found ‚úÖ
```

---

### üß∞ Optimization (Search Pruning)

We can apply **search pruning** by checking whether the board contains enough of each character to even form the word.

#### üîé Pre-check Optimization:

```python
from collections import Counter

if len(word) > rows * cols:
    return False

board_letters = Counter(char for row in board for char in row)
word_letters = Counter(word)

for ch in word_letters:
    if word_letters[ch] > board_letters.get(ch, 0):
        return False
```

Also, we can **reverse the word** if it starts with a less frequent character, increasing the chance of early failure.
