**Problem Statement**

Given `n` machine learning models, each with an associated cost and feature compatibility. The cost of the `i`-th model is specified by the array element `cost[i]`. Additionally, each model is characterized by a binary string, `featureAvailability[i]`, indicating its suitability for two distinct features:

- `"00"` â†’ The model is not equipped for either feature.
- `"01"` â†’ The model is designed for feature A but not for feature B.
- `"10"` â†’ The model is designed for feature B but not for feature A.
- `"11"` â†’ The model is suitable for both features.

A set of models is considered **k-capable** if the number of models in that set suitable for feature A and the number of models suitable for feature B are both greater than or equal to `k`.

For each value of `k`, ranging from `1` to `n`, the goal is to determine the minimum cost required to assemble a set of `k`-capable machine learning models. The task is to return an array of `n` integers, where the `i`-th integer denotes the minimum cost of acquiring a set of `i`-capable models. If no feasible combination exists for `i`, the corresponding `i`-th integer will be `-1`.

**Approach**

1. **Categorize Models**  
   - Group models into three lists based on `featureAvailability[i]`:
     - `type_01` â†’ Models supporting only feature A (`"01"`)
     - `type_10` â†’ Models supporting only feature B (`"10"`)
     - `type_11` â†’ Models supporting both features (`"11"`)

2. **Sort by Cost**  
   - Sort each category in ascending order based on cost to prioritize cheaper models.

3. **Compute Prefix Sums**  
   - This allows efficient retrieval of the sum of the cheapest `k` elements from each category.

4. **Iterate Over \( k = 1 \) to \( n \)**  
   - Try different combinations of models ensuring at least `k` models for both **feature A** and **feature B**.
   - Use a **greedy approach** to minimize cost by leveraging `type_11` models where beneficial.

5. **Store the Results**  
   - If a valid selection exists for `k`, store the minimum cost.
   - If no selection is possible, store `-1`.

**Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Sorting each category** â†’ \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Prefix Sum Computation** â†’ \( O(n) \)
- **Iterating for k and finding combinations** â†’ \( O(n) \)
- **Overall Complexity** â†’ \( O(n \log n) \) (dominated by sorting)

**Example Walkthrough**

### **Input**
```java
n = 5;
cost = {3, 2, 4, 6, 1};
featureAvailability = {"01", "10", "11", "01", "10"};
```

### **Categorization**
```
Type 01 (Feature A only): [3, 6]
Type 10 (Feature B only): [2, 1]
Type 11 (Both features): [4]
```

### **Sorted Lists**
```
Type 01: [3, 6]   â†’ Prefix Sum: [0, 3, 9]
Type 10: [1, 2]   â†’ Prefix Sum: [0, 1, 3]
Type 11: [4]      â†’ Prefix Sum: [0, 4]
```

### **Output**
```java
[6, 10, -1, -1, -1]
```

**Implementation**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinCostKCapable {
    public static int[] minCostKCapable(int n, int[] cost, String[] featureAvailability) {
        List<Integer> type01 = new ArrayList<>(); 
        List<Integer> type10 = new ArrayList<>(); 
        List<Integer> type11 = new ArrayList<>(); 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (featureAvailability[i].equals("01")) {
                type01.add(cost[i]);
            } else if (featureAvailability[i].equals("10")) {
                type10.add(cost[i]);
            } else if (featureAvailability[i].equals("11")) {
                type11.add(cost[i]);
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(type01);
        Collections.sort(type10);
        Collections.sort(type11);

        int[] prefix01 = computePrefixSum(type01);
        int[] prefix10 = computePrefixSum(type10);
        int[] prefix11 = computePrefixSum(type11);

        int[] result = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);

        int len01 = type01.size();
        int len10 = type10.size();
        int len11 = type11.size();

        for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
            int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int x = 0; x <= Math.min(k, len11); x++) {
                int remainingA = k - x;
                int remainingB = k - x;
                if (remainingA <= len01 && remainingB <= len10) {
                    int costX = prefix11[x] + prefix01[remainingA] + prefix10[remainingB];
                    minCost = Math.min(minCost, costX);
                }
            }
            result[k - 1] = (minCost == Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? -1 : minCost;
        }
        return result;
    }

    private static int[] computePrefixSum(List<Integer> list) {
        int[] prefix = new int[list.size() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + list.get(i);
        }
        return prefix;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        int[] cost = {3, 2, 4, 6, 1};
        String[] featureAvailability = {"01", "10", "11", "01", "10"};
        int[] result = minCostKCapable(n, cost, featureAvailability);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));
    }
}
```
